Hi there,

my name is Paul. I am a programmer in Munich. I didn't start out that
way but studied financial mathematics and got a PhD in quantitative
finance at Ulm University. I am interested in programming languages,
especially in strongly typed functional progrmming languages,
dependent types, AI and machine learning. I mostly write C++ and
Python during the day, but secretly I am a Haskell fanboy and plan to
collaborate in its imminent grab for world power.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto://paul.koerbitz@gmail.com) or [follow

<h1>Types and Tailcalls - yet another programmer's blog</h1>

<p>This blog is written by <a href="/about.html">Paul KÃ¶rbitz</a>. It deals
    mostly with programming languages and the web, with the occasional odd
    thought thrown in between.</p>

<p>Contrary to what is suggested by the title, interesting posts on
    type theory and programming language implementations will probably be
    rare... I lack the smarts ;)</p>

## Introduction

_Principles_: Things that are - the territory, not the map. We can not change them, we can only _break ourselves against them_.

_Paradigm_: How we see things - our beliefs. This often determines how we act. Seeing is being. Story of the mini paradigm shift in New York metro of a father and his kids going wild. People were angry, but the he said "we're just comming from the hospital where their mother died one hour ago.".

_P/PC Balance_: Production / production capability. Fundamental principle in many things. Story about the goose laying golden eggs (greedy farmer kills goose after a while to get all golden eggs - but there are none and he has now eliminated the production capability).

## Habit 1 - Be Proactive

_Response-able_: We can _**choose**_ our own response. Proactivity means doing so and taking responsibility for it. Story of Victor Frankl who discovered this last human freedom in the Nazi concentration camps.

_Initiative and Resourcefulness_: What can _I_ do to change something.

_Circle of influence / circle of concern_: Circle of influence: things one   can influence. Circle of concern: things one things about. Reactive people have a much larger circle of concern than a circle of influence. Proactive people focus their energy in their circle of influence.

## Habit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind

Story about one's own funeral in 3 years. What would you like your family, friends, co-workers and community members to say?

## Habit 3 - Put first things first

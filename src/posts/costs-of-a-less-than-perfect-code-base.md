As programmers, we've all had the experience to work on a codebase that
was less than perfect, messy or outright catastrophic. While there can
be good business reasons to get into technical debt, the reasons for
getting out of them are sometimes not that clear, or there is doubt
if they are worth the cost that paying technical debt might incur.
I've been thinking about this a bit lately, so here is my list
of the costs that being in technical debt can cause.

## Definition

Before we get into the costs of messy code bases, I want to at least
attempt to say what I mean by a messy code base.

### Supreme Court Definition of Mess

Every programmer has what you might call the "Supreme Court Definition
of Technical Debt", namely I know it when I see it. Another famous take
on this is the illustrated by the following XKCD comic:

### Turn over

## Staying out of it
### Follow best practices
### Reach consensus
### Knowing the cost of NIH
### Experiment and clean up after yourself

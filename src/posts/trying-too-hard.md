I'm re-visiting the [book on ultralearning](./ultralearning-book-summary.html) I had first read in 2019.
As I'm re-reading the book and my old post I'm again excited by the opportunities that ultralearning
has to offer. There are just so many topics that I would like to learn and get better at. Ultralearning
offers the promise that yes, I can get significantly better at many of them, even while dealing with the
responsbibilities of my busy live.

If this is so exciting to me, why am I only coming back to this topic now, after almost four years? Shouldn't
I have been busy ultralearning all this time and now boast a wide array of impressive skills or
mastery of one or more topics? Well, I probably should and maybe would, if I hadn't
[thrown in the towel](./ultralearning-datascience-week-10.html) at the end of my first and (so far)
last ultralearning project. What happened here?

Looking back, I realize that I had set too ambitious goals for myself. I was **trying too hard**. I
got excited, promised myself I would work really hard and did 
(or [failed sometimes](./dont-beat-yourself-up.html)) but came up short. Frustrated, I gave
up and abandoned the whole project, exciting or not.

I've realized that I did (and probably still do) this a lot. But lately, I've also found that
a different approach, namely just starting and iterating has given me great results. Start moving
in the right direction, then see what tweaks I can make to improve. Just keep moving. As an example,
at over 40, I might be fitter now than I've ever been. I re-started going to the gym about one year ago
without any grand goals. But I saw results and kept tweaking my process. 

So I want to stop trying too hard. Just get started, move in the right direction and continuously
tweak my approach. Goals can still be useful, but I want to use them as tools, not as my master.
And be careful to not be too ambitious and unrealistic in the beginning. Perfect is the enemy
of the good.

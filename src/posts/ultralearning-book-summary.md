## Stories

The book starts out with a number of stories of ultralearners and ultralearning projects.
They sound all quite incredible and they really made me excited about the book. I just
list the ones which I found more interesting.

- **MIT CS BS in a year:** The author completed all exams and projects of a bachelor of
    computer science from MIT in one year.
- **Four languages in one year:** The author stayed in four countries for three months each
    (Spain, , China, South Korea) learning the language to at least conversational level).
- **Public Speaking Semifinalist:** To test if ultralearning could be learned, the author
    ran experiments with a number of a number of learners. One of them decided to learn
    public speaking and ended up being a public speaking world championship semi-finalist,
    seven months after starting. This ended up changing his career by becomming a high-paid
    public speaking coach.

## Ultralearning Principles

1. **Metalearning:** Start by learning how to learn what you want to learn.
2. **Focus:** Improve concentration during learning.
3. **Directness:** Learn by doing.
4. **Drill:** Improve the weakest point. Break down complex skills into parts, master those parts, put them back together.
5. **Retrieval:** Test yourself to learn. Actively recall information.
6. **Feedback:** Is uncomfortable but crucial. Extract the signal from the noise.
7. **Retention:** Learn to remember things forever.
8. **Intuition:** Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills.
9. **Experimentation:** True mastery comes not from following a known path but exploring new possibilities.

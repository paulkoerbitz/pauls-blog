## Stories

The book starts out with a number of stories of ultralearners and ultralearning projects.
They sound all quite incredible and they really made me excited about the book. Here are
the ones which I found more interesting.

- **MIT CS BS in a year:** The author completed all exams and projects of a bachelor of
    computer science from MIT in one year.
- **Four languages in one year:** The author stayed in four countries for three months each
    (Spain, Brazil, China, South Korea) learning the language to at least conversational level).
- **Public Speaking Semifinalist:** To test if ultralearning could be learned, the author
    ran experiments with a number of learners. One of them decided to learn
    public speaking and ended up being a public speaking world championship semi-finalist,
    seven months after starting. This changed his career by becomming a high-paid
    public speaking coach.

## Ultralearning Principles

The precise techniques of ultralearning can vary from subject to subject,
thus it cannot simply be broken down to tools and tactics, but there
are nine principles which embody a universal approach to ultralearning:

1. **Metalearning:** Start by learning how to learn what you want to learn.
2. **Focus:** Improve concentration during learning.
3. **Directness:** Learn by doing.
4. **Drill:** Improve the weakest point. Break down complex skills into parts, master those parts, put them back together.
5. **Retrieval:** Test yourself to learn. Actively recall information.
6. **Feedback:** Is uncomfortable but crucial. Extract the signal from the noise.
7. **Retention:** Learn to remember things forever.
8. **Intuition:** Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills.
9. **Experimentation:** True mastery comes not from following a known path but exploring new possibilities.

Finally, the **ethos** behind ultralearning is to be in charge of your learning
and **maximize your return on investment**. With this ethos, principles can be
considered guideposts instead of hard and fast rules.


## Principle 1: Metalearning

**Metalearning** is the activity of deciding how to go about the learning. There are
three components to this, the **why**, the **what** and the **how**.


### Why

The reason **why** you want to learn something can roughly be *intrinsic*
(learning for its own benefit) or *instrumental* (learning to obtain some
other goal, e.g. advancing in ones career).

Especially with instrumental learning it is key to validate that what you
want to learn actually helps you what you really want. An example of failing
at this is somebody getting an MBA to advance in their career only to discover it
doesn't help them much after getting it. A good way to prevent this is the
**expert interview**: find somebody who has what you want (e.g. great career in
your field) and ask them if they think your approach (e.g. get MBA) is a good one.
Best do this face-to-face or video chat, not email, to not miss nuances.

Expert interviews can also help with *intrinsic* learning goals.


### What

How is the knowledge in your subject structured? Split knowledge into
**concepts** (things that need to be understood), **facts** (things
that need to be memorized) and **procedures** (things that need to
be practiced). Then **draw your map** by identifying the most challenging
concepts, facts and procedures and use this knowledge to make learning
time more effective and efficient.


### How

First, find the common ways in which people learn what you want to learn,
this is called **benchmarking**. For anything taught at university, a
**curriculum** or **syllabus** is a first stop, also a **list recommended of
textbooks** might help. Also **finding people who have mastered the skill**
and performing **expert interviews** should help.

Finding the right material **has a very high payoff** as this will be the
basis for all learning.

Once benchmarking is done **emphasize** areas that align with your goal
and **exclude** or delay areas that don't align.


### How Much Planning vs Doing?

Typically, people don't spend enough time to define goals and plan the
learning approach. However, planning can also become a form of procrastination.
Spending **approximately 10%** of the total learning time on metalearning is
a good rule of thumb. So 10 hours of a 100 hour project. For large projects
(e.g. 500 hours) may be a bit less and move more towards 5%.
One **should know** about **common methods of learning** and **popular resources**
and **tools**.

**Metalearning** is **not a one time thing**. It might make sense to re-research
when hitting plateaus or problems. **Do metalearning when the mariginal
benefits of metalearning are larger than actual learning**, and learn otherwise.


### Long Term Benefits

The real benefits of metalearning is longterm, as many of the skills and
techniques identified can be applied to more than one project. But payoff
can be high even for a single project.


## Principle 2: Focus

There are three aspects of focus: starting, sustaining, and optimizing
the quality of one's focus.

### Problem 1: Failing to Start Focusing (aka Procrastination)

Procrastination is obviously a problem. Two tips in this book about how
to handle it (a) start very small, e.g. by working for five minutes on a
topic, then graduating to pomodoros, etc. and (b) become conscious why
you're starting to procrastinate, which can be (b-i) because of aversion
of the task for some reason (what exactly?) and (b-ii) because of attraction to
some other task (what and why?).

### Problem 2: Failing to Sustain Focus (aka Getting Distracted)

**Flow** is nice, but ultralearning, just like deliberate practice, might
be too hard for it sometimes. Don't worry too much about it.

**How long** should you practice? Going too long isn't optimal, 50 minutes
to one hour is best, so if multiple hours for study taking some breaks is
probably optimal. Also, learning different subjects / aspects during this
time might be good, but learning too many different things is not.

### Distraction Sources:

1. **Your environment**: Phone, internet, people interrupting, TV, games,
    noises sounds. Optimize environment to help sustain focus.
2. **Your task**: Some tasks are easier to focus on, e.g. watching video
    might (or not?) be easier to focus on than reading. If something is more
    cognitive demanding, then it is generally easier to focus on.
3. **Your mind**: Can generate a lot of distractions, especially if it is
    filled with strong emotions. Major life crisis can make focus a lot
    harder, so dealing with these things first might be better.

### Problem 3: Creating the Right Kind of Focus

Two interesting variables: arousal and task complexity. For low complex
tasks, relatively high arousal is good, while too high arousal makes it too
easy to get distracted. For highly complex tasks (e.g. math), a bit
lower arousal and more relaxed focus is better.

If stuck on a very complex task, no focus, i.e. taking a break, can be best
for the unconscious mind to come up with a solution.

### Improve Your Ability to Focus

Recognize where you are and try to improve in small steps.

Personal observation: Motivation helps a lot with focus. If I am very eager
to perform a task, I can focus well. Probably links strongly to the
Procrastination Equation.


## Principle 3: Directness

### The problem with Transfer

It has been shown many times, initially by Edward Thorndike and
Robert Woodworth in 1901 (*"The Influence of Improvement in One
Mental Function upon the Efficiency of Other Functions"*) that
transfer from one learned skill to other skills is problematic
and often does not ocurr to anywhere near the degree that people hope.

### Overcoming the Problem of Transfer with Directness

**Directness**, i.e. learning by doing or focusing directly on the
skill you want to perform during your learning overcomes the problems
with transfer in two ways: first, by focusing on the skill directly,
the need for transfer is significantly diminished. Second, by focusing
on the real world applicability, many subtle skills that *do transfer*
which are needed for real world application of the skill are also learned
and these are more likely to transfer to other situations.

### How to Learn Directly

**Direct learning is hard**, it is often more frustrating, challenging and
intense than reading a book or sitting through a lecture, this is a source
of a **competitive advantage**.

Some tactics for direct learning:

1. **Project based learning**: Opt for projects which produce something - at
    least you will learn how to produce that thing! Can also be producing a
    paper, book, online course, etc.
2. **Immersive learning**: Surround yourself with the target environment in
    which the skill is practiced. Obvious for languages, but applicable much
    more widely.
3. **Flight simulator method**: When practicing the skill is not possible
    directly (flying, surgery, ...), a simulation which requires the same
    cognitive skills (decisions, use knowledge) is the best alternative.
4. **The overkill approach**: Increase the difficulty of the challenge by
    creating more intense versions of the taks than you actually want to
    perform (e.g. speaking in front of middleschoolers, who pull no punches).


## Principle 4: Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point

In Chemistry there is the concept of the **rate limiting step**. In a chain
reaction, the slowest part of the chain determines the speed of the whole
reaction. Similary when learning a skill, the performance of a certain subskill
may limit the overall performance. The principle of drill is meant to adress
this rate limiting step. The goal then, is to identify the sub-skill or
cognitive component that is the weakest and create drills to improve this
area.


### Direct-then-drill

Drilling is somewhat at odds with the **direct** principle, which states
to practice the skill directly, minimizing the difference between practice
and application. Drilling is still needed, because it is easier to improve
a subskill when focusing on it, and in fact this might be needed to improve
overall performance. However, it is important that the drill is based on
observing weaknesses when performing the actual skill, and that the drilled
subskill is re-integrated into the full skill after drilling. Picking the
right drill based on direct practice is called the **direct-then-drill**
approach. Overall, this approach has four steps:

1. Practice the skill directly
2. Find an improvable subskill
3. Drill the subskill
4. Integrate the subskill into the direct practice again


### Tactics for Drills

1. **Time slicing:** Practice one part of a longer sequence (common in
    music)
2. **Cognitive components:** Focus on one cognitive aspect, e.g. grammar
    or pronounciation when learning a language
3. **Copying:** Copy other's work then focus only improving the part that
    you want to drill (e.g. structure of argument in writing).
4. **Magnifying glass:** While practicing the whole skill, spend more
    time and concentration on the subcomponent you want to improve, even
    if that decreases overall performance.
5. **Prerequisite chaining:** Start learning something that you don't
    have all the prerequisites for, then cycle back and forth between
    prerequisites and original learning object.

### Drill Mindfully

Drills are important, but it is very important to be careful that the
drills actually connect to the real skill. This is the weakness of
many academic programs, which mostly focus on drilling while the
drills are disconnected from the actually desired skills.


## Principle 5: Retrieval: Test to Learn

Learning works better when trying to retrieve something than spending
additonal time to review it. This maybe because
retrieving information is more difficult than reviewing it, and **difficulty
is desireable in learning** as long as we are still able to perform the task.

### How to Practice Retrieval

There are a few methods we can use to practice retrieval:

1. **Flash cards:** We can use flash cards, which combines well with
    spaced reptetition system (SRS - also see principle 7).
2. **Free recall:** Difficult but powerful is to practice free recall,
    i.e. to try to remember as much as possible after learning something.
    For example, after a lecture we might sit down and write down
    everything we can recall from that lecture.
3. **Question book method:** While reading something, write questions
    instead of notes. Be careful to write the questions at the right
    (=not too low) level. Later practice retrieval by answering
    these questions.
4. **Self-generated challenges:** When learning something, think of
    challenges where this material can be applied, then apply it.
5. **Closed-book learning:** Test yourself with the book closed,
    i.e. force yourself to retrieve when testing or applying your
    knowledge instead of looking it up.


## Principle 6: Feedback

### Positive and Negative Effects of Feedback

Research shows that feedback has overall positive impact on learning,
but can also have significant negative effect. Negative effects usually ocurr
when feedback is (taken to be) directed at a persons ego, not the skill.
This can be hard to separate and feedback is **often hard to take**. However,
for this reason **feedback provides a significant competitive advantage**. It is
important to not take feedback as a critique of ones person but of the
skill.

### Types of Feedback

There are three levels of feedback from least to most granular:

1. **Outcome based feedback:** Gives a single piece of information,
    e.g. a single grade, pass / fail information. This is the most
    frequent and easiest to obtain, but also gives the least
    information
2. **Informational feedback:** Informational feedback is more
    detailed than outcome based feedback, basically it is feedback
    on each line item that contributes to the outcome. On an exam,
    this could be feedback on each question (vs the whole exam,
    which would be outcome based).
3. **Corrective feedback:** This type of feedback not only tells
    you what went wrong but also how the correct solution looks
    and why that is the case. This is the hardest type of feedback
    to get. Its important that it comes from an actual expert,
    otherwise it might be wrong, misleading and hurtful.

You need to be **careful when trying to upgrade feedback**, because
the information might not actually be there.

### Ways to Improve Feedback

1. **Noice cancellation:** Remove as much noise from measurements
    as possible and focus on metrics that more directly tell you
    what you want to know. E.g. when looking for feedback
    on the quality of your blog posts, don't use views as feedback
    (depends on a wide number of uncontrollable factors) but
    the rate of people reading a post until the end.
2. **Difficulty sweet spot:** Feedback is information, and the
    information content is the highest when it is unpredictable.
    Optimize the difficulty so that you don't know in advance
    what kind of feedback you will be getting. Don't make things
    too easy, but also do not make them impossibly hard.
3. **Meta feedback:** Meta feedback is feedback on the overall
    learning process, e.g. monitoring the learrning rate.
4. **Rapid fire feedback:** Getting lots of feedback early on
    can be very helpful because (a) it takes away the fear
    from feedback and (b) **knowing your work will be evaluated
    is a huge motivator for doing a good job**.


## Principle 7: Retention: Stop Filling a Leaky Bucket

Forgetting is a problem when learning. It is a natural process
and can't be fully prevented, but minimizing its effect on the
learning effort is important for effective learning.

### Theories About Forgetting

There are three theories about forgetting:

1. **Decay:** Memories just fade over time.
2. **Inference:** Old memories are (partially) overwritten by
    newer ones. This is a common phenomenon when learning a new
    foreign language (e.g. Spanish) makes it harder to speak an older
    one (e.g. French).
3. **Forgotten cues:** The information is still there, but the
    cue needed to access it is forgotten. This could explain
    the tip of the tongue problem.

No theory can explain forgetting by itself completely,
so they might all be in force to different degrees for different
memories.

### Ways to Prevent Forgetting

There are four ways presented in how we can slow down or prevent
forgetting:

1. **Spaced repetition:** Spaced repetition algorithms optimize
    when to retrieve a certain item in order to not foget this
    and move it to long term memory. This is used
    in flash card systems such as Anki.
2. **Procedularization:** Procedures (e.g. riding a bycicle) are
    forgotten much more slowly than abstract facts. Another case is
    "muscle memory" for keyboard shortcuts or passwords.
    Learning skills to the level where they become automatic procedures
    is useful in preventing forgetting.
3. **Overlearning:** Once a small skill or fact is fully learned,
    learning it more might not improve performance, but it can
    prevent forgetting. In a way, this might be seen as the early
    stage of procedularization.
4. **Mnemonics:** Mnemonic techniques make it easier to remember
    hard to remember information such as numbers by associating
    them with easier to remember things such as images or stories.
    While they clearly work, they can be somewhat brittle and work
    best for memorizing abstract facts - something that isn't that
    useful to remember anymore.


## Principle 8: Intuition: Go Deep Before Building Up

### Story: Richard Feynman

This chapter starts with a story about Richard Feynman, the famous
physicist. It explains how Feynman's in-depth understanding of
Mathematics and Physics on a first-principle level gave him an
extrodinary intuition. Feynmans moto was *Don't fool yourself - and
you are the easiest to fool!*. He also used to *think of concrete
examples when trying to understand something abstract*.


### First Principle Thinking

First principle thinking, i.e. understanding something based
on the fundamental principles has been shown
to be much more powerful and lead to better intuition than
shallower levels of thinking, such as understanding by analogy
or pattern matching. However, it is also requires expert knowledge
and is this not possible to do in the beginning.

### Feynman Technique

Young's *Feynman Technique* is an exercise in understanding
something based on first principles. It consists of two steps:

1. Write a concept or problem on the top of a sheet of paper.
2. Then write an explanation. For a *concept* explain it to
    somebody who doesn't know anything about it. For a *problem*
    explain in detail how a solution works and why.

This can be applied to *things you don't understand*, *problems
you're stuck on* and to *expand your intuition*.

### How to Build Intuition

1. **Don't give up** on hard problems. When you are about to give
    up, set a *struggle timer*, to e.g. give yourself another ten
    minutes to work on the problem and stop then.
2. **Prove or explain** something to understand it. An example is to
    *draw a bicycle* to explain how it works.
3. **Use a concrete example** when thinking about an abstract concept
    or technique.
4. **Don't fool yourself** into thinking you understand something when
    you really don't. Ask a lot of questions to make sure your
    understanding is solid.


## Principle 9: Experimentation

 True mastery comes not from following the path trodden
 by others, but from exploring possibilities they haven’t yet
 imagined - *experimentation is the key to mastery*.

### Story: Van Gogh

This chapter starts with a story about Vincent van Gogh, who started
painting late in his life and was rejected from art schools. He learned
painting by experimenting with a lot of different styles, finally finding
his signature style after many failed attempts.

### Things to Experiment With

1. **Learning resources:** The first place to experiment is with
    learning resources, methods and learning techniques. Before
    making changes, make sure that you have really applied
    yourself to a specific technique.

2. **Different subfields:** Once the basics of a skill have been
    mastered, there are usually a lot of different things one
    could learn next.

3. **Style:** Many skills (writing, design, music, leadership, art,
    ...) don't have a single correct way of doing things. Experiment
    with different styles to find your own unique style.

### Experimentation Tacticis

There are a number of tactics that can be used for experimentation:

1. **Copy and change:** Copy work, then experiment with changing
    some aspects of it.
2. **Vary one variable:** Varying a single dimension while holding
    everything else constant enables directly comparing the results.
3. **Add new contraints:** Adding new constraints often sparks
    creative solutions.
4. **Combine two skills:** One way to obtain mastery is to not
    be the best at one skill, but the best at the combination
    of two, not frequently combined skills (e.g. engineering and
    public speaking).
5. **Go to extremes:** In high dimensions, most volume of a spehere
    is near the surface. This may indicate that in high-dimensional
    skills, mastry usually involves two extreme sub-skills. Don't
    expect mastry by taking the safe or average option on everything.

### Learning is experimentation

Experimentation lies at the heart of much of learning. A lot of the
suggested methods in the book started out as experiments, and there
were many other experiments that did not work out.


## Your First Ultralearning Project

This chapter aims to be a guide to a first ultralearning project.

### Do Your Research

The first step consists of deciding what to learn, which includes
finding the learning materials.

1. **Topic and scope:** The topic is obvious, but giving it a good,
    concrete goal clarifies the next steps a lot. As such *be able
    to hold a 15 minute conversation in Mandarin* is a much better
    goal than to *learn Chinese*.

2. **Primary learning materials:** Identify and obtain the primary
    materials you will be learning with.

3. **Benchmark how others learned:** Find out how others have learned
    this material and inform your learning plan with it.

4. **Direct practice activities:** How can you directly practice the
    skill you would like to learn?

5. **Backup material and drills:** What non-primary learning materials
    which may be used as backup? What possibilities are there to
    perform drills?

6. **Feedback** How can you get feedback on your learning? Can you
    improve the type of feedback or the frequency in which you get
    it? What kind of meta feedback could you collect?

### Schedule Your Time

Find a consistent schedule and put it into your calendar. If you're
unwilling to do that it is be a sign that your heart is not in the
project. It is better to have a consistent schedule than to try to
*find the time when it arises* which typically does not work.

Work should be done in consistent chunks of time. For most activities,
it is best if these are **not too long** streches (max 1 hour) or are at
least seperated by breaks. However some activities, such as programming
have a long ramp up time and thus need some significant streches of time.

### Execute Your Plan

After doing research and scheduling the time, it is time to execute
the plan. During execution, monitor how you're doing with respect
to the nine ultralearning principles: metalearning, focus, directness,
drilling, retrieval, feedback, retention, intuition and experimentation.
Make adjustments if necessary.

### Review Your Results

After your ultralearning project ends, it is important to review the
results to improve your approach to your next ultralearning project.
*What went well?* *What went badly?*

When there are problems, it is tempting to blame a lack of willpower
or discipline, but often the *problems can be traced to the initial
plan*.

### Maintain or Master

After completing the ultralearning project, how would you like to
proceed? The options are to either *maintain* the knowledge through
less frequent practice, *relearn* at a later point in time or to
push further and pursue *mastery*.

### Alternatives to Ultralearning

Finally, the book mentions that the intense method of ultralearning
is not the only way to go. More casual *low intensity methods*, such
as reading books, keep learning on the job are great ways to keep going.
*Formal education* also has many benefits.


## An Unconventional Education

The book closes with a discussion of the *Polgar sisters*, the children
of [Laszlo Polgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r)
who had set out to train his children to become geniuses
and had indeed succeeded in raising three girls who all became
extrodnary chess players, one of them beating world champion Garry Kasparov
once. There are many parallels between the ultralearning methods
presented in the book and the methods used by the Polgar sisters.


## Conclusion

I found the book motivating and thought provoking. I could see many
of the methods laid out here to be benefitial and the combination of
them to have an important impact on learning effectiveness. Certainly
a lot of the success depends on the intensity by which one pursues an
ultralearning project and the examples in the book are surely the
positive outliers, but I still believe that much more effective and
better learning is possible with these methods.

I am looking forward to attempt my first ultralearning project and see
how these techniques and methods work for me.

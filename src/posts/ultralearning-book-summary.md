## Stories

The book starts out with a number of stories of ultralearners and ultralearning projects.
They sound all quite incredible and they really made me excited about the book. I just
list the ones which I found more interesting.

- **MIT CS BS in a year:** The author completed all exams and projects of a bachelor of
    computer science from MIT in one year.
- **Four languages in one year:** The author stayed in four countries for three months each
    (Spain, , China, South Korea) learning the language to at least conversational level).
- **Public Speaking Semifinalist:** To test if ultralearning could be learned, the author
    ran experiments with a number of a number of learners. One of them decided to learn
    public speaking and ended up being a public speaking world championship semi-finalist,
    seven months after starting. This ended up changing his career by becomming a high-paid
    public speaking coach.

## Ultralearning Principles

Ultralearning cannot vary from subject to subject, thus it cannot simply be broken
down to tools and tactics, but there are nine principles which embody a universal
approach to ultralearning:

1. **Metalearning:** Start by learning how to learn what you want to learn.
2. **Focus:** Improve concentration during learning.
3. **Directness:** Learn by doing.
4. **Drill:** Improve the weakest point. Break down complex skills into parts, master those parts, put them back together.
5. **Retrieval:** Test yourself to learn. Actively recall information.
6. **Feedback:** Is uncomfortable but crucial. Extract the signal from the noise.
7. **Retention:** Learn to remember things forever.
8. **Intuition:** Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills.
9. **Experimentation:** True mastery comes not from following a known path but exploring new possibilities.

Finally, the **ethos** behind ultralearning is to be in charge of your learning
and maximize your return on investment. With this ethos, principles can be
considered guideposts instead of hard and fast rules.


## Principle 1: Metalearning

**Metalearning** is the activity of deciding how to go about the learning. There are
three components to this, the **why**, the **what** and the **how**.


### Why

The reason **why** you want to learn something can roughly be *intrinsic*
(learning for its own benefit) or *instrumental* (learning to obtain some
other goal, e.g. advancing in ones career).

Especially with instrumental learning it is key to validate that what you
want to learn actually helps you what you really want. An example of failing
at this is getting an MBA to advance in their career only to discover it
doesn't help them much after getting it. A good way to prevent this is the
**expert interview**: find somebody who has what you want (e.g. great career)
and ask them if they think your approach (e.g. get MBA) is a good one. Best
do this face-to-face or video chat, not email, to not miss nuances.

Expert interviews can also help with *intrinsic* learning goals.


### What

How is the knowledge in your subject structured? Split knowledge in
**concepts** (things that need to be understood), **facts** (things
that need to be memorized) and **procedures** (things that need to
be practiced). Then **draw your map** by identifying the most challenging
concepts, facts and procedures and use this knowledge to make learning
time more effective and efficient.


### How

First, find the common ways in which people learn what you want to learn,
this is called **benchmarking**. For anythiing taught at university, a
**curriculum** or **syllabus** is a first stop, also **list recommended of
textbooks** might help. Also **finding people who have mastered the skill**
and performing **expert interviews** should help.

Finding the right material **has very high payoff** as this will be the
basis for all learning.

Once benchmarking is done **emphasize** areas that align with your goal
and **exclude** or delay areas that don't align.


### How Much Planning vs Doing?

Typically, people don't spend enough time to define goals and plan the
learning approach. However, planning can also become a form of procrastination.
Spending **approximately 10%** of the total learning time on metalearning is
a good rule of thumb. So 10 hours of a 100 hour project. For large projects
(e.g. 500 hours) may be a bit less and move more towards 5%.
One **should know** about **common methods of learning** and **popular resources**
and **tools**.

**Metalearning** is **not a one time thing**. It might make sense to re-research
when hitting plateaus or problems. **Do metalearning when the mariginal
benefits of metalearning are larger than actual learning**, and learn otherwise.


### Long Term Benefits

The real benefits of metalearning is longterm, as many of the skills and
techniques identified can be applied to more than one project. But payoff
can be high even for a single project.

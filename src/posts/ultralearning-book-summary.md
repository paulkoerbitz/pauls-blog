## Stories

The book starts out with a number of stories of ultralearners and ultralearning projects.
They sound all quite incredible and they really made me excited about the book. I just
list the ones which I found more interesting.

- **MIT CS BS in a year:** The author completed all exams and projects of a bachelor of
    computer science from MIT in one year.
- **Four languages in one year:** The author stayed in four countries for three months each
    (Spain, , China, South Korea) learning the language to at least conversational level).
- **Public Speaking Semifinalist:** To test if ultralearning could be learned, the author
    ran experiments with a number of a number of learners. One of them decided to learn
    public speaking and ended up being a public speaking world championship semi-finalist,
    seven months after starting. This ended up changing his career by becomming a high-paid
    public speaking coach.

## Ultralearning Principles

Ultralearning cannot vary from subject to subject, thus it cannot simply be broken
down to tools and tactics, but there are nine principles which embody a universal
approach to ultralearning:

1. **Metalearning:** Start by learning how to learn what you want to learn.
2. **Focus:** Improve concentration during learning.
3. **Directness:** Learn by doing.
4. **Drill:** Improve the weakest point. Break down complex skills into parts, master those parts, put them back together.
5. **Retrieval:** Test yourself to learn. Actively recall information.
6. **Feedback:** Is uncomfortable but crucial. Extract the signal from the noise.
7. **Retention:** Learn to remember things forever.
8. **Intuition:** Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills.
9. **Experimentation:** True mastery comes not from following a known path but exploring new possibilities.

Finally, the **ethos** behind ultralearning is to be in charge of your learning
and maximize your return on investment. With this ethos, principles can be
considered guideposts instead of hard and fast rules.


## Principle 1: Metalearning

**Metalearning** is the activity of deciding how to go about the learning. There are
three components to this, the **why**, the **what** and the **how**.


### Why

The reason **why** you want to learn something can roughly be *intrinsic*
(learning for its own benefit) or *instrumental* (learning to obtain some
other goal, e.g. advancing in ones career).

Especially with instrumental learning it is key to validate that what you
want to learn actually helps you what you really want. An example of failing
at this is getting an MBA to advance in their career only to discover it
doesn't help them much after getting it. A good way to prevent this is the
**expert interview**: find somebody who has what you want (e.g. great career)
and ask them if they think your approach (e.g. get MBA) is a good one. Best
do this face-to-face or video chat, not email, to not miss nuances.

Expert interviews can also help with *intrinsic* learning goals.


### What

How is the knowledge in your subject structured? Split knowledge in
**concepts** (things that need to be understood), **facts** (things
that need to be memorized) and **procedures** (things that need to
be practiced). Then **draw your map** by identifying the most challenging
concepts, facts and procedures and use this knowledge to make learning
time more effective and efficient.


### How

First, find the common ways in which people learn what you want to learn,
this is called **benchmarking**. For anythiing taught at university, a
**curriculum** or **syllabus** is a first stop, also **list recommended of
textbooks** might help. Also **finding people who have mastered the skill**
and performing **expert interviews** should help.

Finding the right material **has very high payoff** as this will be the
basis for all learning.

Once benchmarking is done **emphasize** areas that align with your goal
and **exclude** or delay areas that don't align.


### How Much Planning vs Doing?

Typically, people don't spend enough time to define goals and plan the
learning approach. However, planning can also become a form of procrastination.
Spending **approximately 10%** of the total learning time on metalearning is
a good rule of thumb. So 10 hours of a 100 hour project. For large projects
(e.g. 500 hours) may be a bit less and move more towards 5%.
One **should know** about **common methods of learning** and **popular resources**
and **tools**.

**Metalearning** is **not a one time thing**. It might make sense to re-research
when hitting plateaus or problems. **Do metalearning when the mariginal
benefits of metalearning are larger than actual learning**, and learn otherwise.


### Long Term Benefits

The real benefits of metalearning is longterm, as many of the skills and
techniques identified can be applied to more than one project. But payoff
can be high even for a single project.


## Principle 2: Focus

There are three aspects of focus: starting, sustaining, and optimizing
the quality of one's focus.

### Problem 1: Failing to Start Focusing (aka Procrastination)

Procrastination is obviously a problem. Two tips in this book about how
to handle it (a) start very small, e.g. by working for five minutes on a
topic, then graduating to pomodoros, etc. and (b) become conscious why
you're starting to procrastinate, which can be (b-i) because of aversion
of the task for some reason (what?) and (b-ii) because of attraction to
some other task (what and why?).

### Problem 2: Failing to Sustain Focus (aka Getting Distracted)

**Flow** is nice, but ultralearning, just like deliberate practice, might
be too hard for it sometimes. Don't worry too much about it.

**How long** should you practice? Going too long isn't optimal, 50 minutes
to one hour is best, so if multiple hours for study taking some breaks is
probably optimal. Also, learning idfferent subjects / aspects during this
time might be good, but too many different things is not.

### Distraction Sources:

1. **Your environment**: Phone, internet, people interrupting, TV, games,
    noises sounds. Optimize environment to help sustain focus.
2. **Your task**: Some tasks are easier to focus on, e.g. watching video
    might (or not?) be easier to focus on than reading. If something is more
    cognitive demanding, than it is generally easier to focus on.
3. **Your mind**: Can generate a lot of distractions, especially if it is
    filled with strong emotions. Major life crisis can make focus a lot
    harder, so dealing with these things first might be better.

### Problem 3: Creating the Right Kind of Focus

Two interesting variables: arousal and task complexity. For low complex
tasks, relatively high arousal is good, while too high arousal makes it too
easy to get distracted. For highly complex tasks (e.g. math), a bit
lower arousal and more relaxed focus is better.

If stuck on a very complex task, no focus, i.e. taking a break, can be best
for the unconscious mind to come up with a solution.

### Improve Your Ability to Focus

Recognize where you are and try to improve in small steps.

Personal observation: Motivation helps a lot with focus. If I am very eager
to perform a task, I can focus well. Probably links strongly to the
Procrastination Equation.


## Principle 3: Directness

### The problem with Transfer

It has been shown many times, initially by Edward Thorndike and
Robert Woodworth in 1901 (*"The Influence of Improvement in One
Mental Function upon the Efficiency of Other Functions"*) that
transfer from one learned skill is problematic and often does not
ocurr anywhere near the degree that people hope.

### Overcoming the Problem of Transfer with Directness

**Directness**, i.e. learning by doing or focusing directly on the
skill you want to perform during your learning overcomes the problems
with transfer in two ways: first, by focusing on the skill directly,
the need for transfer is significantly diminished. Second, by focusing
on the real world applicability, many subtle skills that *do transfer*
which are needed for real world application of the skill are also learned
and these are more likely to transfer to other situations.

### How to Learn Directly

**Direct learning is hard**, it is often more frustrating, challenging and
intense than reading a book or sitting through a lecture, this is a source
of a **competitive advantage**.

Some tactics for direct learning:

1. **Project based learning**: Opt for projects which produce something - at
    least you will learn how to produce that thing! Can also be producing a
    paper, book, online course, etc.
2. **Immersive learning**: Surround yourself with the target environment in
    which the skill is practiced. Obvious for languages, but applicable much
    more widely.
3. **Flight simulator method**: When practicing the skill is not possible
    directly (flying, surgery, ...), a simulation which requires the same
    cognitive skills (decisions, use knowledge).
4. **The overkill approach**: Increase the difficulty of the challenge by
    creating more intense versions of the taks than you actually want to
    perform (e.g. speaking in front of middleschoolers, who pull no punches).

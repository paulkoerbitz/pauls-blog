## How the Seventh Week Went

I had my last day at my old job this week. It took me a little to wind down
and I didn't feel like jumping full force into the learning project right
away - that's why this post is comming out a day late. During the last few
days at my old job I didn't do any learning and I also did only limited
learning last Thursday and Friday.

Not my usual self, I decided to give me an extra day to complete my goals
for the last week and jumped in and worked on getting the simple neural
network up and running today. In the process, I discovered the fantastic
new [colab] service from google which enabled me to run a GPU-powered
notebook much quicker and more easily than when fidling with the setup in
paperspace or via a cloud provider. One of the drawbacks however was that
I'm running the fast.ai library version 1.0 there and not 0.7 as in the
lectures. No matter, I thought, why go with the past, I'll figure out
how this new library works. That took longer than expected, but at least
in the process I discovered that (what was shown of) the 0.7 version of
the fast.ai library was a very thin wrapper around pytorch and that these
parts were easily worked around. I think this was time well spent, because
while the "batteries included" style of fast.ai's library is great to
get best practices packaged, I do like to look a little bit under the
surface.

I also worked on reviewing the fast.ai courses so far and produced some
summary charts and notes. I'm not quite done with this yet. I also didn't
complete the review of the course by Andrew Ng. To be honest I am a bit
frustrated with the pace of my progress. I really think that I should be
making progress much faster. My time is limited, I need to make the most
of it and I don't think I've been doing this too well ;(


## Reviewing Goals for Week 7

Looking back at my goals for week 7, here are the results:

1. *[done]* Get the neural net notebook to work.
2. *[done]* Watch lectures 11 and 12 of fast.ai.
3. *[in progress]* Review fast.ai lectures, consolidate and publish meeting notes and write Anki cards.
4. *[failed]* Keep reviewing lecture notes from the ML coursera course by Andrew Ng and write
    Anki cards (no completion required).

## My Goals for Week 8

This is one of the few weeks which I can truely dedicate full time to learning
data science and now I have four days left in it. These are my goals for this week:

1. Complete review of fast.ai lectures
2. Complete review of Andrew Ng's ML course
3. Start Deeplearning.ai course
4. Start fast.ai deep learning for coders course
5. Apply neural networks on Rossmann challenge
6. Start SVG conversion project

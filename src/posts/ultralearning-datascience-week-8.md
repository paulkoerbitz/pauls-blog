## How the Eighth Week Went

This week was the first week where I was completely off. And low and behold,
I actually got some things done during this week. I finished the review and
summary  of the [fast.ai introduction to machine learning](/notes/Fast-ai-ML-course-notes.html)
course, which took way longer than I had thought, but also refreshed many things and led me
to sit down and understand a few things I hadn't before. I might even turn
one or two of these things into a blogpost. I also got started with the
[deeplearning.ai] and [practical deep learning for coders] courses. I also
started the [SVG project] by collecting and starting to review some publications
with similar goals. And I've read through the first chapter of the [neural networks
and deep learning book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).

I didn't manage to complete the review of the first Andrew Ng's course, so that
task is back on my list. This week I would also like to complete the first
[deeplearning.ai] course and go through lessons 2-4 of the fast.ai
course all while taking and publishing notes on these courses. In terms of
practical experiments, I want to apply the different text classification
approaches from the first fast.ai course to my own text-classification problem
and also do some practical experiments on the [SVG project]. I also want to
write a neural network and taining from scratch and run it on the MNIST dataset.


## Reviewing Goals for Week 8

Looking back at my goals for week 8, here are the results:

1. *[done]* Complete review of fast.ai lectures
2. *[failed]* Complete review of Andrew Ng's ML course
3. *[done]* Start Deeplearning.ai course
4. *[done]* Start fast.ai deep learning for coders course
5. *[failed]* Apply neural networks on Rossmann challenge
6. *[done]* Start SVG conversion project

## My Goals for Week 9

I have some free time, but Christmas is comming up and will eat some of that
time. Here is what I'm aiming to get done this week:

1. Complete review of Andrew Ng's ML course, create flashcards
2. Complete the first [deeplearning.ai] course with notes and flashcards
3. Complete lectures 2-4 of the fast.ai course with notes and lectures
4. Complete NLP experiments on my own text classification project
5. Do some practical experiments on the SVG project.
6. Implement Neural Network from scratch and train it on MNIST data.

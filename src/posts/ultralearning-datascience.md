My [last post](/posts/ultralearning-book-summary.html) was a summary
of the book Ultralearning by Scott Young. As a learning addict, I am
really excited by this book and want to try out the techniques in my
own learning projects. After weighting a number of different subjects
I've settled on learning data science. It so happens that I'm changing
jobs towards the end of the year which will give me a little bit of much
needed time. Overall I have approximately 2,5 months until starting in
the new place.


## Goals

*Learning data science* is quite vague - what do I actually mean by this?
A better definition of my goal is the following:

*Given a data modelling problem, I want to be able to come up with a
reasonable solution and solve all aspects of the problem end to end.*

This is more concrete and can be made even more precise by explaining
what I mean with some of the terms:

  - *data modelling problem*: This could be any Kaggle challenge or
    similar problems of my own choosing.
  - *reasonable solution*: Something that is in the top 10-20% of the
    Kaggle submissions (tbh I don't know how hard this is - if it is
    really hard I would also be happy with a lower percentile).
  - *solve all aspects of the problem end to end*: Starting from an
    idea, I want to be able to design the overall appraoch (data needed,
    models, what the final solution should do), obtain data, clean it,
    select and try different models, optimize and build a working
    solution from this.

Basically, I want to be able to approach problems in the data science
space and come up with reasonable solutions that do the job, even if
they are maybe not the absolute best.

A second goal in the *learning data science* space is that *I want know
and understand the most important models, techniques and tools.*  I want
to be able to understand the solutions of others and have some intuition
why an approach works or doesn't work, what else could be tried, etc.


### Non-Goals

2,5 months while having a job and a family isn't much, so there must also
be some things that I will not learn. Amongst these is that my goal is *not
to deeply understand the math* behind most models. While I would also like
to aquire some background and understand why some methods work or do not
work (which will certainly include some math), my goal is not to understand
and/or be able to reproduce deriations or proofs. If I succeed in this
challenge I might take this up later, but its not something that I want to
include right now.


## Learning Approach and Materials

I am planning to mainly work with the following learning materials:

### Primary Learning Materials

 1. *Kaggle challenges*: A great source for actual problems to work on.
    It also gives the opportunity to learn from the solutions of others.
    There are also some introductory challenges which are targeted at
    beginners such as myself.

 2. *[Fast AI](http://fast.ai)*: The hands-on courses by Jeremy Howard
    seem ideal for the type of learning I want to do. I want to complete
    the [Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders](http://course18.fast.ai/ml)
    and the two [deep](https://course.fast.ai/) [learning](https://course.fast.ai/part2)
    courses.

 3. *Personal challenges*: I have some personal data modelling challenges that
    I would like to have solutions for. Explaining these is outside of the scope
    of this blog post, but one of my goals is to be able to solve these. I will
    get to them in the second half of the challenge what I have hopefully aquired
    a bit more knowledge.

### Background Material

In addition to the primary learning materials, I will use the following books
to suplement my learning.

  - An Introduction to Statistical Learning & Applications in R
  - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
  - The Elements of Statistical Learning Data Mining, Inference & Prediction
  - Deep Learning: Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning

The goal is not to read these books cover to cover, but to use them as references
or background information in case I feel like I need some additional explanations
or would like (and have the time) to go deeper in a certain topic.

### My Background

I have a background in mathematics and finance and have worked as a programmer
(and more recently CTO) for close to 10 years, so I won't need to learn
programming or unix tools. I am also familiar with probability
theory and statistics and have dabbled with data science in the past (such as
taking the well-known Stanford machine learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera)
but have never done anything real with it. This background certainly makes this
challenge more approachable than for somebody truely starting "from scratch".

### Material for Drills

I don't really know yet where my weaknesses will be and what parts I need to drill
on, but I believe that working on existing Kaggle challenges, possibly copying the
work of others and then focusing or experimenting with a specific aspect would make
good drills.

### Retrieval and Retention

To optimize learning, I want to practice free recall for the lectures I watch.
So after watching a lecture, I will sit down and write down the things that I can
recall from it. I want to use the Feynman technique (write a concept on a sheet
of paper, then explain it in depth without looking things up) on concepts.
Another approach that I would like to take is to explain or discuss the things I
have learned to my colleagues.

To limit forgetting, I plan to write and review flash cards using
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) on concepts  I want to remember. I have used Anki
also when refreshing my algorithm knowledge,
and it has been a tremendous help in commiting things to long term memory. By doing
this I've realized that I was often hampered by having already forgotten things that
I had previously learned.


## Scheduling

Having a job and a family makes finding the time for this endeavour
challenging - it often seems like finding the time is one of the hardest
things. On week days I plan to:

- work 45-60 minutes on this in the morning (getting up earlier)
- spend around 30 minutes of my lunch break on learning
- spend another 45-60 minutes in the evening

This gives between 2 hours and 2,5 hours per week day. On weekends I will be
able to put in 2-3 hours per day.

This comes out to about 15 hours per week. This regime will last
for 6.5 weeks, which gives 6.5 * 15 = 97.5, so almost 100 hours.

There will be about 4 weeks where I will be off, and during this time I will be
able to spend more time on learning, probably about 35 hours per week (I still have
family committments), this gives me another 140 hours approximately.

So all in all I can dedicate about 240 hours to this project - this is
a little less than 1.5 months of full time work.

### There's Never Enough Time

Again, it feels like with a job and family, there is never enough time
to really learn anything, but 240 hours is certainly something. Anyway,
I am very happy with my personal situation and would not change it for
anything in this world, so in spite of some semi-regular whining about
time, what I really want to do is do the best with this time and make
the most of every minute. I am a little embarrassed to admit that more
often than I like, I don't make the best of the little learning time
that I do have and spend some part of it by browsing HN or losing time
in similar ways. Doing it better this time will be essential to make
this project a success. The upside of having a busy schedule is that
it forces you to be more efficient and careful what you spend your
time on.

To be mindful of my time, and also to check if I can really meet my
estimates of the time I can spend, I will use a time tracking app to keep
track of what I am doing and how much time I spent on each activity.
Hopefully this will reinforce that I have a limited amount of time
to dedicate to this project and improve my focus. It will also enable
me to review how much time goes into each activity and re-adjust my
approach based on the perceived value of each item. I will report on
this in my weekly reports (see below).


## Getting Feedback

A last thing that I think is really important is to get enough feedback
during the learning process. I want to collect feedback as follows:

  - Kaggle results: How do I perform on the Kaggle challenges that I
    attempt?

  - Meta feedback: How do my Kaggle rankings develop? Am I getting better?
    How quickly (i.e. what's my learning rate)? If not why not?

  - Weekly review posts: I want to write a weekly post discussing my
    progress. I want to submit these posts to reddit
    (e.g. [/r/datascience](https://reddit.com/r/datascience)
    or [/r/learnmachinelearning](https://reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning))
    and then get some feedback and advice via the comments. I don't know if
    they want me, but I will try.

  - Local meetups: Munich has two large data science meetups - I want
    to present this learning project there and hopefully find some mentors
    who can provide direct feedback on my resuls and how I should adjust
    my schedule. Maybe I can even find some kind of mentor who can help
    me with direct feedback.


### Plan for Week 1

To kick this off, here is my plan for the first week:

  - Getting a working setup up and running, probably a
    remote setup on a site like Paperspace.

  - Fully complete at least three Kaggle challenges, starting
    with the [Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
    and the [Bluebook for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers)
    challenges.

  - Fast AI lectures: Watch and take notes on the first
    two lessons from the machine learning course on fast.ai
    and the first lesson in the deep learning for coders
    course.

  - Write a blogpost that reviews the results from last week
    and plans the next week. I want to report the time I have
    been able to spend, concepts, models and insights I have
    learned, the Anki cards that I have created and my plan
    for the next week.


## Taking the Leap

It does feel a little bit scary to commit to this challenge, especially
with the plan to *put myself out there* by blogging about it, submitting
the posts to the reddit crowd and going to local meetups to talk about it.
But this level of committment also makes this fun and exciting and I think
much more likely that I will actually learn a big deal instead of dabbling
again a little bit before giving up. Stay tuned!

# My Stoicism Cheat Sheet

Stoicism has been a useful philosphy of life to me. It helps me overcome anxiety, focus on what's within my control, be a better person and attain tranquility and joy. This is my brief summary.

## Stoic Values

The stoics thought **we should live virtuous** by which they meant **living in accordance with (human) nature**. **Our one capacity** that sets us appart from animals is **our ability to reason**, so **we should be rational and reasonable**. Living this way **lets us attain tranquility** and satisfaction. We should love mankind and fulfill our social duties.

**Fame and fortune are not valuable**, so we should not pursue them. Neither is within our control and even if we obtain them, they could be taken at any moment. They can corrupt our character and striving for them will require us to compromise our tranquility, which is more valuable.

We can attain tranquility if we focus on being virtuous, and use reason to extinguish unnecessary negative emotions such as anger, grief, fear and anxiety. This is within our control and is therefore where we must focus our efforts.

## Practices and Psychological Techniques

### Negative Visualization

Imagine bad things to happen to you and those around you. You die, your children die, your house burns down, you lose your job. All of these things can and some will happen. Imagining them beforehand prepares you and allows you to appreciate them while you have them.

Everything we have is on loan from fortune and may be reclaimed at any moment.

### Dichotomy of Control

Some things are up to us, some things are not up to us, if we have any reason we need to focus on what's within your control.

This implies we should “internalize”, i.e. break down any goals to focus on the parts which are fully within our control and do our best on these.

### Fatalism

We cannot change the past or the present (this very moment), so it does not make sense to worry or complain about it. If we want things to happen to us exactly as they do happen we can use them to build our character. Challenges make us stronger.

### Self-Denial

Occasionally deny yourself pleasures to practice for their loss and appreciate the things you do have. Go hungry, underdress in cold weather, shower cold, sleep on the floor, etc.

### Stoic Meditation

Periodically reflect on how your actions are in line with stoicsim. Where have you made progress, where can you improve?

## Stoic Advice

### Desire

We should want things to happen exactly as they do happen. Forestall hedonic adaptation through negative visualisation. Want the things you already have.

### Insults

Many things can be considered insults, including slights, omissions, etc. If we feel a sting it (can be considered) an insult.

Is the “insult” true? If yes, then there is no reason to be offended by it. Do we respect the insulter? If no, then we should be glad that they think lowly of us, we should question when they do otherwise. If we do respect the insulter we can take what they said as feedback and investigate it for what's true about it.

### Anger

Anger as temporary insanity. We should forestall it's rise, once we're truely angry it's hard to control. There is a moment between stimulous and response that we must seize (Victor Frankl).

### Anxiety

If we fully focus on what's within our control we need not be anxious. Being anxious is a sign that we don't and that we want things to go a certain way that we can't control. Focus on what's within our control and apply fatalism to the rest.

### Complaining

Don't. What about this is within your control? Do something about that. What is outside of it? It does not make sense to worry or complain about that part.
